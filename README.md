# Binary Search Tree Rebalancing

This Java project demonstrates the functionality of rebalancing a binary search tree (BST) to maintain its balance. A balanced BST ensures that search, insertion, and deletion operations have optimal time complexity.

## Project Overview

This project includes the following components:

1. **BinarySearchTree**: Represents a binary search tree. Provides methods for insertion, traversal, and rebalancing.
2. **BinaryTreeNode**: Represents a node in the binary search tree. Contains an element, left child, and right child.
3. **BinaryTreePrint**: Utility class for printing the binary tree structure.

## Functionality

### 1. Insertion
- Use the `BinarySearchTree` class to insert elements into the binary search tree.

### 2. Rebalancing
- Utilize the collected elements to rebalance the binary search tree.
- The `rebalance()` method in the `BinarySearchTree` class performs the rebalancing operation.

### 3. Printing Tree Structure
- The `BinaryTreePrint` class provides a utility to print the tree structure.
- The rebalanced tree structure can be visualized using the `printTree()` method.
